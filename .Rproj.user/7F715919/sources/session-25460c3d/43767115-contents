I am a [Schmidt Science Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/) and Postdoctoral Researcher at New York University in the [Bergelson Lab](https://bergelsonlab.org/). I earned my PhD in [Quantitative and Computational Biology program](https://lsi.princeton.edu/qcbgraduate) at Princeton University, where I was advised by [Jonathan Levine](https://levine.princeton.edu/) and [Simon Levin](https://slevin.princeton.edu/).

My research combines theory and experiment to understand how diverse ecological communities stably coexist. I am especially interested in interactions that uniquely emerge in diverse communities, often called higher-order interactions. I conduct experiments with annual plants in the field and microbial strains in the lab. In parallel, I build and analyze theoretical models for how species interactions impact diverse coexistence. Check out my [research](research.qmd) or [publications](publications.qmd) for more details.
