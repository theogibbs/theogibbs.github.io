I am a <a href="https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/">Schmidt Science Fellow</a> and Postdoctoral Researcher in the <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/departments/biology/research/gsb/cgsb.html">Center for Genomics and Systems Biology</a> at New York University in the <a href="https://bergelsonlab.org/">Bergelson Lab</a>. I earned my PhD in <a href="(https://lsi.princeton.edu/qcbgraduate">Quantitative and Computational Biology program</a>
at Princeton University, where I was advised by <a href="https://levine.princeton.edu/">Jonathan Levine</a> and <a href="https://slevin.princeton.edu/">Simon Levin</a>. <br>

My research combines theory and experiment to understand how diverse ecological communities stably coexist. I am especially interested in interactions that uniquely emerge in diverse communities, often called higher-order interactions. I conduct experiments with annual plants in the field and microbial strains in the lab. In parallel, I build and analyze theoretical models for how species interactions impact diverse coexistence.
