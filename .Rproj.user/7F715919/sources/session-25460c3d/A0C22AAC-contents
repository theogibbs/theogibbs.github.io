    In a workshop run by one of my thesis labs, we bring local community college students on a camping trip to a marsh ecosystem for a weekend. We teach basic field skills like plant identification and transect surveys so that the students can collect and analyze ecological data in one weekend. We then lead a brief discussion of what career opportunities are available to students interested in ecology and some of the barriers students face when seeking out research experience.

### Quantitative and Computational Biology Graduate Program Virtual Open House

Working with a team of graduate students and the Access, Diversity and Inclusion team at Princeton, I founded the first and now annual Quantitative and Computational Biology Graduate Program Virtual Open House, which aims to provide admissions resources to prospective Quantitative and Computational Biology graduate students from historically under-represented backgrounds. We host a faculty panel on graduate admissions and organize informal graduate student discussions. Over the last four years running this program, we have reached more than 500 prospective graduate students, some of whom are now current Quantitative and Computational Biology students at Princeton. In the coming years, the team at Princeton aims to expand this program to include an in-person component as well.

### Teaching Assistantships and Tutoring

I was a teaching assistant for the course Mathematical Methods in Biology and Medicine with Professor Corina Tarnita in 2023 and  Theoretical Ecology with Professor Simon Levin in 2022.  I was also a tutor in the Princeton Online Tutoring Network that was formed during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide free tutoring assistance to under-served K-12 students in the local community. I partnered with the Trenton Arts at Princeton program to tutor elementary and middle school students at Trenton and Princeton Public Schools while they transitioned to exclusively online learning.
