I earned my PhD from the [Quantitative and Computational Biology program](https://lsi.princeton.edu/qcbgraduate) at Princeton University, where I was advised by [Jonathan Levine](https://levine.princeton.edu/) and [Simon Levin](https://slevin.princeton.edu/).\n\nMy research combines theory and experiment to understand how diverse ecological communities stably coexist. I am especially interested in interactions that uniquely emerge in diverse communities, often called higher-order interactions. I conduct experiments with annual plants in the field and microbial strains in the lab. In parallel, I build and analyze theoretical models for how species interactions impact diverse coexistence.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is a Quarto website.\n\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
