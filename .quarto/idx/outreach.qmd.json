We host a faculty panel on graduate admissions and organize informal graduate student discussions. Over the last four years running this program, we have reached more than 500 prospective graduate students, some of whom are now current Quantitative and Computational Biology students at Princeton.

I was also a tutor in the Princeton Online Tutoring Network that was formed during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide free tutoring assistance to under-served K-12 students in the local community. I partnered with the Trenton Arts at Princeton program to tutor elementary and middle school students at Trenton and Princeton Public Schools while they transitioned to exclusively online learning.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n### Annual Plant Field Ecology Workshop with the Levine Lab\n\n```{=html}\n\n<div>\n    <div style=\"float: right; position: relative; top: 0px; right:-15px; padding: 15px\">\n    <img style=\"float: right\" position: relative; width = 225 src=\"camping.jpg\" />\n    </div>\n    <div>\n    <div style=\"float: right; position: relative; top: 0px; right:-15px; padding: 15px\">\n    <img style=\"float: right\" position: relative; width = 225 src=\"group.png\" />\n    </div>\n    In a workshop run by one of my thesis labs, we bring local community college students on a camping trip to a marsh ecosystem for a weekend.
